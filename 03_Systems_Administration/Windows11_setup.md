## Overview:
This guide documents the clean installation of Windows 11, which I performed to rebuild a test machine. I followed Microsoft's best practices and created a reusable installation procedure.
## Steps:
**On a Seperate Windows Machine**:
- Navigate to official microsoft website: (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11).
- Download windows 11 media creation tool
- Insert a clean USB (I used a clean 16gb USB).
- Run the media creation tool and follow the prompts to create a **bootable USB**.
    
**Clean Install On Target Laptop**:
- Insert the bootable USB.
- Power on the laptop and press F12 to enter BIOS.
- Select USB as boot device.
- Choose language, time, and keyboard layout.
- Choose custom install only.
- At partitions screen, delete all existing partitions and select the remaining unallocated space to ensure a clean installation.
- Choose personal or work/school setup.
- Connect to network and sign-in to microsoft account.
- Configure privacy settings as desired.
